DEMO

This project is a demo project consisting of a form which requires 3 fields and directly stores the data to
a jpdb database.

According to my experience it has provided abstraction which improves usability. With least coding and logic one can make good use of this data base.

This project was made and released on git hub on 1/9/2021.
